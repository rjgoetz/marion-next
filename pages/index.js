                    We have a choice and a higher duty to protect, enforce, and
                    provide for the animals in our care. Only the highest
                    quality and safest food standards of Human- Grade and Kosher
                    gives us this opportunity. These standards are what control
                    food sources, food additives, and processing conditions that
                    are free from direct and cross contamination of allergens,
                    pathogens, and toxins.

                    Our food not only exemplifies quality by its smell and high
                    animal acceptance, but also by its ability to retain water
                    without falling apart and resist failure in moist,
                    high-humidity outdoor applications. These food attributes
                    lead to increased animal acceptance and food digestibility,
                    feeding protocol flexibility, and lower food waste and cost.
